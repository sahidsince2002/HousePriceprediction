House Price Prediction using Linear Regression
This repository contains a Python project for predicting house prices using a linear regression model. In this project, we will walk you through the process of training a linear regression model to predict house prices based on various features of the houses.

Overview
House price prediction is a common problem in the field of machine learning and real estate. By developing a linear regression model, we can estimate the price of a house based on factors such as its square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and other relevant features.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is located in the Housing_data.csv file. It contains information about various houses, including features like square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and the corresponding house prices. This dataset is used for training and testing the linear regression model.

Training the Model
The Jupyter NotebookPredicting_house_price.ipynb provides detailed instructions on how to load the dataset, preprocess the data, train a linear regression model, and make house price predictions. You can follow the step-by-step guide within the notebook.

Results
The model's performance and predictions can be evaluated by examining the metrics and visualizations provided in the Jupyter Notebook. You will gain insights into how well the model performs in predicting house prices.
