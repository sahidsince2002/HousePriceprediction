TASK 1 :- House Price Prediction using Linear Regression


This repository contains a Python project for predicting house prices using a linear regression model. In this project, we will walk you through the process of training a linear regression model to predict house prices based on various features of the houses.

Overview :
House price prediction is a common problem in the field of machine learning and real estate. By developing a linear regression model, we can estimate the price of a house based on factors such as its square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and other relevant features.

Dataset :
The dataset used in this project is located in the House_Pricing_LR directory named as Housing_data.csv. It contains information about various houses, including features like square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and the corresponding house prices. This dataset is used for training and testing the linear regression model.

Training the Model :
The Jupyter Notebook Predicting_house_price.ipynb provides detailed instructions on how to load the dataset, preprocess the data, train a linear regression model, and make house price predictions. You can follow the step-by-step guide within the notebook.

Results : 
The model's performance and predictions can be evaluated by examining the metrics and visualizations provided in the Jupyter Notebook. You will gain insights into how well the model performs in predicting house prices.

TASK 2 :-  Wine Quality Prediction using Linear Regression

Overview : 
Wine quality prediction is a common application of machine learning in the field of oenology. By developing a linear regression model, we aim to estimate the quality of wine based on factors such as acidity, alcohol content, residual sugar, and other relevant attributes.

Dataset : 
The data set used in this has been downloaded from kaggle named as winequality-Red which has attributes like acidity, alcohol content, residual sugar, and, most importantly, quality ratings. This dataset serves as the basis for training and testing the linear regression model.

Training the Model : 
The Jupyter Notebook wine_qulty.ipynb provides detailed instructions on how to load the dataset, preprocess the data, train a linear regression model, and make wine quality predictions. The notebook takes you through the entire process step by step.

Results
You can evaluate the model's performance and predictions by examining the metrics and visualizations provided in the Jupyter Notebook. This will give you insights into how effectively the model predicts wine quality based on the chosen attributes.
