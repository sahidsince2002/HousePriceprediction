Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to the Machine Learning Projects repository! This repository contains three distinct machine learning projects that demonstrate various aspects of data analysis, modeling, and prediction using Python.

## Projects Included

1. **House Price Prediction using Linear Regression**
This project focuses on predicting house prices based on a set of features using Linear Regression. Linear Regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm for predicting numerical values. In this project, we train a model to learn the relationship between various features of a house (e.g., square footage, number of bedrooms, location) and its price. The model can then make predictions about the price of a house based on these features.
   - Detailed instructions for running the code can be found in the project folder.

2. **Wine Quality Prediction using Linear Regression**
In this project, we build a model to predict the quality of wine using Linear Regression. Wine quality prediction is a regression task where the goal is to estimate a numerical quality score for a wine based on attributes such as acidity, alcohol content, and more. Linear Regression is used to create a linear model that relates these attributes to the wine quality score. This project demonstrates how to apply regression techniques to solve real-world problems.
   - Detailed instructions for running the code can be found in the project folder.

3. **Iris Flower Classification using Logistic Regression**
This project is centered around classifying Iris flowers using Logistic Regression. Classification is a common machine learning task where the goal is to categorize data into different classes or groups. In this project, we use the famous Iris dataset, which contains measurements of iris flowers' sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Logistic Regression is used to build a model that can classify iris flowers into their respective species (setosa, versicolor, or virginica) based on these measurements. This project showcases how to approach a classification problem using a widely used algorithm.
